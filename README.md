## How to 

## 1. Include dependency in your build.gradle file

```
compile 'com.md.cfv:customfontview:0.0.1'
```

## 2. Implement `CustomFontView` in your xml file and supply name of your font in `fontName` attribute

```
   <com.md.cfv.CustomFontView
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="Hello World"
            app:fontName="Lobster.ttf" />
```

## 3. Put that font file in `assets` folder. That's it.

## Quite easy. Isn't it ?
